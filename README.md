The Gallery  <br />
The University of British Columbia <br />
5:30 PM  <br />**

# So, Where is it?
In the afternoon, we will be having a small, private ceremony with our family. The reception afterwards will be held at The Gallery, at the University of The British Columbia, and we hope to see you there!

# How do I RSVP? 
Please send your RSVP to adamandlindseywedding@gmail.com.

# How do we get there?
The Gallery is on the fourth floor of the UBC Student Nest, located at the University of British Columbia. The address is 6133 University Blvd, Vancouver. If you're planning to get there by transit, it is very close to the final stop of the 99 B-Line. If you're driving, the nearest parking lot is the North Parkade (https://parking.ubc.ca/map)

# When is it?
Please meet us at the Gallery for cocktails at 5:30. Dinner will begin at 6:30, and we're hoping to get to the dancing and socializing at 8! We don't get kicked out until one or two. 

# Do you have a gift registry?
We sure don't! It is very kind of you to think of that, but we are really just very happy to be able to spend an evening with those who are important to us. If you absolutely insist, cash is the best gift! It can be anything we want. Alternatively, consider donating in our honour to: https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/wedding-registry-19/

# Who did that great drawing on the invitation?
Our wonderful friend Leelee! She's the best! Feel free to tell her that when you see her at the wedding.

# I've got a food allergy!
Please let us know! We are going to strive to have vegetarian and vegan options, but we want to make sure there is something for everyone. 

# Wow you sound prepared!
I assure you, we are not.
